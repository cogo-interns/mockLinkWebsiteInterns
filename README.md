# Mock Intern Website for Link Ventures/Link Studio Internship
This website serves as a central hub for our internship program, offering essential information and a seamless application experience for prospective interns.

## Deployment
Website is currently deployed using GitHub pages at https://cogo-interns.github.io/mockLinkWebsiteInterns/ 

## How to Add More Pages
### Making a New Card on the Home Page
Each card follows a similar format in the HTML section of the index.html file.
<a href="PATH TO ACTUAL PAGE" class="card" data-card="3">
        <div class="IMAGE NAME FOR PREVIEW" style="background-image: url('IMAGE PATH FOR PREVIEW');"></div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <h3>TITLE OF PAGE</h3>
          <p>DESCRIPTION OF PAGE.</p>
          <div class="card-arrow">Learn More</div>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
  </section>

### Making the Page
Each page has its own file (learn.html, build.html, network.html, etc.) that all live in the main directory, along with any images they use. 
Each page has a different format, so there's no particular template.
